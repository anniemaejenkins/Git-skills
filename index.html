      I was born in Spartanburg, SC though I currently live in Greenville, SC.
       Before coding, I invested most of my time in artwork.
       I have been doing art since I was a toddler.
       As I grew up, I realized how competitive the art scene was and having came from poverty, had no desire to follow a career path that struggled in money.
       I was never so good with art that I would've made a good living with it and I realized it was more of a theraputic thing for me.
       Aside from art, I have always been interested in technology and coding was something I had practiced online in blog themes and such.
       So I figured I might have a better chance at being able to afford to live if I invest in a future with code.
